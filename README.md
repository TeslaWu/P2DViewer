# P2DViewer

P2DViewer is a third-party extension/library for Processing Java, allowing users to manage shapes in an object-oriented manner. With a Viewer that can be panned and zoomed, you can observe your shapes in Processing. Changes in various properties of shapes can be easily represented in the form of animations.

## Features

-   You can observe different P2DViewer shapes(VObj) with a Viewer that can be panned and zoomed.
-   You can manage their shapes as VObj Java Objects.
-   You can change the properties of a VObj (like size, color, etc.) with smooth animation by calling one simple method.
-   You can manage the timing of triggering animation effects to create interactive Processing slideshows.

## Installation

Just simple download the P2DViewer.jar and use it in your Java Processing Project.
Or you if you are using Windows, you can use the P2DViewer Project Maker.exe to build a project without managing .jar files.
